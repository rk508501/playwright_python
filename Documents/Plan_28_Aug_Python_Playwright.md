## Chapter 2: Setting Up Your Python Environment

### 2.1 Installing Python
1. Download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Choose the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.12).
3. During installation, check "Add Python to PATH" for easy command-line access.
4. Verify installation: Open a terminal and run `python --version`.

### 2.2 Setting Up a Virtual Environment
Virtual environments isolate project dependencies:
- Install `venv`: It's built-in with Python 3.3+.
- Create one: `python -m venv myenv`.
- Activate: On Windows: `myenv\Scripts\activate`; On macOS/Linux: `source myenv/bin/activate`.
- Deactivate: `deactivate`.

### 2.3 Installing Playwright
Once in your virtual environment:
- Install via pip: `pip install playwright`.
- Install browser binaries: `playwright install`.
This sets up Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### 2.4 IDE Recommendations
Use VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook for coding. Install the Python extension in VS Code for linting and debugging.

## Chapter 3: Basic Python Concepts

### 3.1 Variables and Data Types
Variables store data and don't require explicit type declaration.
- Integers: `age = 25`
- Strings: `name = "Alice"`
- Floats: `price = 19.99`
- Booleans: `is_active = True`

In Playwright: Variables hold page objects or selectors.
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()  # 'page' is a variable holding a Page object
    page.goto("https://example.com")
    title = page.title()  # 'title' stores a string
    print(title)
    browser.close()
```

### 3.2 Operators and Expressions
Use arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`), and logical (`and`, `or`, `not`) operators.

In Playwright: Compare element counts.
```python
element_count = page.locator("button").count()
if element_count > 0:
    print("Buttons found!")
```

**Further Research Prompt:** "Dive deeper into Python's dynamic typing system and how it affects variable usage in libraries like Playwright, with examples of type hints using typing module."

## Chapter 4: Control Structures

### 4.1 Conditional Statements (if-else)
Control flow based on conditions.
```python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("Greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("Equal to 5")
else:
    print("Less than 5")
```

In Playwright: Check if an element is visible.
```python
if page.is_visible("selector='#login-button'"):
    page.click("#login-button")
else:
    print("Login button not visible")
```

### 4.2 Loops (for and while)
- For loop: Iterates over sequences.
- While loop: Runs until a condition is false.

In Playwright: Loop through links on a page.
```python
links = page.locator("a")  # Locator for all anchor tags
for i in range(links.count()):
    link_text = links.nth(i).inner_text()
    print(link_text)
```

While example: Wait for an element.
```python
timeout = 0
while not page.is_visible("selector='.loaded') and timeout < 30:
    page.wait_for_timeout(1000)
    timeout += 1
```

**Further Research Prompt:** "Explore advanced loop techniques in Python, such as list comprehensions and generators, and apply them to iterating over Playwright locators in UI tests."

## Chapter 5: Functions and Modules

### 5.1 Defining and Calling Functions
Functions encapsulate reusable code.
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

In Playwright: A function for login automation.
```python
def login(page, username, password):
    page.fill("#username", username)
    page.fill("#password", password)
    page.click("#submit")

# Usage
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://example-login.com")
    login(page, "user", "pass")
    browser.close()
```

### 5.2 Importing and Exporting Modules
- Create a module: Save functions in `utils.py`.
- Import: `from utils import login`
- Export: No explicit export; all top-level code is importable.

Calling from different modules: If `utils.py` is in the same directory, import as above. For subdirectories, use packages with `__init__.py`.

In Playwright: Organize tests into modules.
- `tests/test_login.py`: Imports from `utils.py`.

## Chapter 6: Data Structures

### 6.1 Lists
Ordered, mutable collections.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits[1])  # "banana"
```

In Playwright: Collect element texts.
```python
elements = page.locator(".item")
item_texts = [elements.nth(i).inner_text() for i in range(elements.count())]
print(item_texts)  # List of strings
```

### 6.2 Dictionaries
Key-value pairs.
```python
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])
```

In Playwright: Store test data.
```python
test_data = {"url": "https://example.com", "selector": "#button"}
page.goto(test_data["url"])
page.click(test_data["selector"])
```

### 6.3 Tuples and Sets
- Tuples: Immutable lists, e.g., `coords = (10, 20)`
- Sets: Unordered unique items, e.g., `unique_ids = {1, 2, 3}`

In Playwright: Use sets to track unique URLs visited.

## Chapter 7: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

### 7.1 Defining Classes
Classes define blueprints for objects.
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(my_dog.bark())
```

### 7.2 Inheritance and Polymorphism
Extend classes.
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        pass

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow"
```

In Playwright: Create a test base class.
```python
class BaseTest:
    def __init__(self):
        self.playwright = sync_playwright().start()
        self.browser = self.playwright.chromium.launch()
        self.page = self.browser.new_page()
    
    def teardown(self):
        self.browser.close()
        self.playwright.stop()

class LoginTest(BaseTest):
    def run_test(self):
        self.page.goto("https://example.com")
        # Perform login
        self.teardown()

test = LoginTest()
test.run_test()
```

This encapsulates setup/teardown logic.

### 8.1 Exceptions
Handle errors gracefully.
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("Cleanup")
```

In Playwright: Handle timeouts.
```python
try:
    page.wait_for_selector("#element", timeout=5000)
except TimeoutError:
    print("Element not found in time")
```

### 8.2 File Handling
Read/write files.
```python
with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello")

with open("data.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
```

In Playwright: Save screenshots or logs.
```python
page.screenshot(path="screenshot.png")
with open("log.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(page.title() + "\n")
```

    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    page.goto("https://google.com")
    page.fill("input[name='q']", "Playwright Python")
    page.press("input[name='q']", "Enter")
    page.wait_for_timeout(2000)
    browser.close()
```

## Chapter 10: Advanced Playwright Concepts

### 10.1 Handling Frames and Dialogs
Switch to iframes.
```python
frame = page.frame_locator("iframe[name='myframe']")
frame.fill("input", "text")
```

Handle alerts.
```python
page.on("dialog", lambda dialog: dialog.accept())
page.click("button[onclick='alert()']")
```

### 10.2 Network Interception and Mocking
Intercept requests.
```python
def handle_route(route):
    if "analytics" in route.request.url:
        route.abort()
    else:
        route.continue_()

page.route("**", handle_route)
page.goto("https://example.com")
```

### 10.3 Running Headless and Parallel Tests
Use `headless=True` for CI/CD. For parallelism, integrate with pytest-playwright.

In classes: Extend for multi-browser testing.
```python
class MultiBrowserTest:
    def test_chromium(self):
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch()
            # Test code
    def test_firefox(self):
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.firefox.launch()
            # Test code
```
