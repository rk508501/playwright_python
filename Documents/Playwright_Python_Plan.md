# Playwright with Python Learning Plan

This Markdown file outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step learning plan for mastering Playwright using Python. Playwright is an open-source automation library for web browsers, allowing you to control Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers programmatically. It's ideal for web scraping, automated testing, and browser automation.

The plan is divided into sections, each covering a key concept or group of concepts. For each section, you'll find:
- **Objectives**: What you'll learn.
- **Key Concepts**: Core ideas and features.
- **Resources**: Suggested official documentation or tutorials (as Playwright's docs are excellent).
- **Learning Prompt**: A ready-to-use prompt you can copy-paste to an AI like Grok (or another LLM) to get a detailed lesson, complete with explanations, code examples, and exercises.

Plan to spend 1-2 hours per section, depending on your pace. Practice by writing and running code in a Python environment. Prerequisites: Basic Python knowledge and familiarity with web concepts (HTML, CSS selectors).
